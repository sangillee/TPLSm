# TPLSm 1.0.1

MATLAB package for performing Thresholded Partial Least Squares (T-PLS).  
T-PLS combines partial least squares with back-projection to fit a large scale regularized linear model.  
Due to its mostly analytical solutions and 'fit once tune later' approach to cross-validation, it can fit cross-validated  
model on big data (both large n & p) in very short time.
